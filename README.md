# Prototype-design-pattern


* It is used when the type of objects to create is determined by a prototypical instance, which is cloned to produce new objects.

### This pattern is used to:

* Avoid subclasses of an object creator in the client application, like the factory method pattern does.


* When you want to copy an object without making your code dependent on its class.


* When you want to produce similar objects without paying the cost of creating new objects using the 'new' operator.
